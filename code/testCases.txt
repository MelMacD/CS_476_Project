Correctness/Functional:
- add/edit/deleting blog content, can see changes persist
- edit blog style (background color, font), changes persist
- create blog creates proper listing on bloglist
- commenting displays the current username, reacting okay
- statistics page shows the right count for reactions, comments

Robustness:
- blog content cannot be dragged out of bounds
- form validation for create blog; leaving image empty uses empty image icon on bloglist page
- blog content cannot be resized below a certain size, images and videos retain aspect ratio
- cannot edit another person's blog
- cannot comment/react/create blog without an account

Time-efficiency:
- load blog content page not over certain time
- upload image not over certain time
- submit changes to blog not over certain time
- comment not over certain time
- react not over certain time
